# Hello everyone,

# in this file we will look for some happyness, and I'll show you where to find it!

# First, in Happy_Data.ipynb we import the datasets with the informations of the World happyness report, which is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness.
# The factors that contribute in evaluating the happyness of each country are: GDP per Capita, Family, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity and Government Corruption.
# The dataset is available online: https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness
# Using Pandas, we clean the dataframe and make some data analysis.

# Finally, in happyness_map.ipynb I created the heat maps shown in Heat_maps.JPG

# In the future I would like to dig into the causes of the discrepancies and further explore the dataframe.
